## Installation

Install the package via npm:

```bash
npm install gemini-multimodal-live-voice-only
```

---

## Usage

Below is an example of how to integrate the package into your React project.

### Basic Setup

1. **Wrap your App with the `LiveAPIProvider`:**

```tsx
import React from 'react';
import { LiveAPIProvider, ControlTray } from 'gemini-multimodal-live-voice-only';
import 'gemini-multimodal-live-voice-only/dist/index.css'; // Import bundled CSS

const App = () => {
  return (
    <LiveAPIProvider
      apiKey="your-api-key"
      dynamicConfig={{
        voiceName: "Kore",
        systemInstruction: {
          parts: [{ text: "You are AI of omiii. Follow the provided tools and instructions." }]
        },
        tools: [
          // Define your tools configuration here, for example:
          { googleSearch: {} },
          { functionDeclarations: {} }
        ]
      }}
    >
      <ControlTray>
        {/* Optionally include additional UI elements */}
      </ControlTray>
    </LiveAPIProvider>
  );
};

export default App;
```

2. **Using the Context in Components**

You can also access the live API context in your components using the `useLiveAPIContext` hook:

```tsx
import React from 'react';
import { useLiveAPIContext } from 'gemini-multimodal-live-voice-only';

const StatusDisplay = () => {
  const { connected, connect, disconnect, volume, muted, mute, unmute } = useLiveAPIContext();

  return (
    <div>
      <h2>Status: {connected ? 'Connected' : 'Disconnected'}</h2>
      <button onClick={connected ? disconnect : connect}>
        {connected ? 'Disconnect' : 'Connect'}
      </button>
      <button onClick={muted ? unmute : mute}>
        {muted ? 'Unmute' : 'Mute'}
      </button>
      <p>Volume: {volume}</p>
    </div>
  );
};

export default StatusDisplay;
```
